For range: curtin knows everything, also gish, and also nelson but he is the busiest. I spread my questions between robert and gish and nelson is last resort

For everything else: beeler and hartlage know it all. hartlage knows literally everything, and beeler knows a lot of things.
hartlage supports 10,000 people a day because he basically runs the whole company. use your little git history tool and you'll find out that hartlage wrote everything of consequence
but beeler is his right hand man so he also knows a ton. beeler does all of the skynet and build system and make file and kpit and jlink and stuff like that
